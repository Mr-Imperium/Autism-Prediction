# Autism Spectrum Disorder Prediction Model

## Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning solution for early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using multiple classification algorithms. By leveraging advanced data preprocessing and machine learning techniques, the model aims to provide a reliable screening tool for potential ASD identification.

## Key Features

- Multiple Machine Learning Models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - XGBoost Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- Advanced Data Preprocessing:
  - Feature engineering
  - Age group categorization
  - Log transformation
  - Label encoding
  - Feature scaling

- Handling Class Imbalance:
  - Random Over-Sampling technique to balance dataset

- Interactive Streamlit Web Application:
  - User-friendly interface
  - Model selection
  - Real-time ASD prediction
